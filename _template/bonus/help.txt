Usage
=====

Open the INDD files with Adobe InDesign ( preferably CS3).

You'll have to re-link your image (100 * 100 px) and change the text with your own and you are ready to print. 

For best printing results use all images in CMYK, 300dpi format.

The INDD files are divided into logical sections and you just have to insert your text / duplicate sections if needed.
